From 1.0.2 to 1.0.3

* UNTESTED FEATURE:
  - Description:
    - A command that allows players to apply in game! I have no one to test it for me so... USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
  - How to use:
    - /sm test
    - Note! This has no permissions and will not be listed in /sm help!
  - What does it do:
    - It'll guide you through the process of applying. The prompts are currently not configurable.
    - Once its done, you can go to ~/StaffManager/players/PLAYER_NAME.yml and you can see the data submitted from there under "applications".
  - What to do:
    - Help me by sending a PLAYER_NAME.yml file to me (If possible also what you entered in the process).
    - Contact me at Skype: skypandafusion
Thank you! :)
