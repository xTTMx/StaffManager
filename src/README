        STAFFMANAGER
#############################
CHANGELOG: v1.1.0 to v2.0.0
INCOMPATIBLE WITH EARLIER FILES!
----------
* Added LICENSE file into the jar.
* Online staff list now displays names in alternate colors.
* COLORED output to console!
* Player Configs changed.
* Config changed.
* /sma ban changed to /sma block; similarly to unban, unblock & banlist, blockedlist
* StaffManager now less verbose, hides error logs in server.log, still sends warning that an error occured to console though.
* More in-depth help, try '/sm help [command]'!
* No more help pages displayed with '/sm' -> changed to '/sm info [page]'**!
  ** More on that at dev.bukkit.org/server-plugins/staffmanager
* '/sm top' removed (Might take up a lot of resources if it has a lot of players)
